# AngularWebapp

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Dependencies
You must have node and npm installed to run. To easily serve, build, or generate components, services, pipes or any supported features you can use angular-cli. To install the angular client from anywhere in the console just run:
```
npm install -g angular-cli
```

## Installation
First you need to clone the repo using SSH or HTTP. It will install into a folder called angular-webapp.
```
git clone git@github.com:thebaron24/angular-webapp.git
```

Then Change directories to the angular webapp.
```
cd angular-webapp
```

Now you need to install the node module dependencies. Inside the angular-webapp folder run:
```
npm install
```

After all of your dependencies are loaded you can run the project with agnular-cli. If you havent already run:
```
npm install -g angular-cli
```

Once you have the angular client installed just run this to serve the webapp:
```
ng serve
```

You can see your new angular 2 webapp at:
```
http://localhost:4200
```

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
